# Fluidnotebook

Fluid Notebook is an online notebook that's built to adapt to any device size and time of day.

## Features
Fluidnotebook adapts to the size of its container, whether that's a computer, a tablet, or a phone - hence the name!
* Takes advantage of web technologies such as responsive CSS and viewports to make text readable on any device.



Automatic night mode
* Night mode turns on at 9PM (following the user's selected timezone)
* Night mode onset times can be customized to the user's needs, or turned permanently on or off
* Device-specific settings can be saved on an encrypted cookie
* Can be toggled on or off using a floating button for unregistered users



Passcode-protected Notebooks
* Private notebooks require a passcode to access


Rearrangeable page order
* Using a doubly-linked data structure, page orders in a fluid notebook can be changed anytime
* Pages can be inserted or deleted and "next" and "previous" pages will update automatically


Rich text editor
* Use advanced text formatting with <a href="https://quilljs.com/">QuillJS</a> text editor
* Copy and paste formatted text directly into the text editor

User account password reset
* Users can reset their password by email if they forgot


## Deprecated
Fluidnotebook was one of my first public-facing projects, but it has now been deprecated and its features integrated into other projects. I learned a lot from its planning, programming, deployment, and maintenance.
