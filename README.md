## Features
Fluidnotebook adapts to the size of its container, whether that's a computer, a tablet, or a phone - hence the name!
* Takes advantage of web technologies such as responsive CSS and viewports to make text readable on any device.

## Deprecated
Fluidnotebook was one of my first public-facing projects, but it has now been deprecated and its features integrated into other projects. I learned a lot from its planning, programming, deployment, and maintenance.

Fluidnotebook was hosted on www.fluidnotebook.com while it was active.
